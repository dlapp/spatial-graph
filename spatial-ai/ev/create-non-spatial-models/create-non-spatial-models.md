# Create non-spatial predictive models

## Introduction

In this lab you create models for predicting EV adoption using a non-spatial regression algorithm. In the previous lab you performed spatial feature engineering to add a feature with the number of charging stations with 10km of each zip code. Here you  train models without and with this feature. You compare model statistics and observe the benefit of spatial feature engineering, even when using a non-spatial regression algorithm.

Estimated Lab Time: xx minutes
